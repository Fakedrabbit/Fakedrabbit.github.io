Im mainly using this Github account for school purposes. It is the basic level account that is free to use,nothing fancy just short an simple.
So this repository is a basic one I belive the point is to create a basic webpage if you will. This one created a link that if you click it It'll show you exactly what I have typed on Github. Now there are two ways you can make this from what I have discovered.
Ok so in order to clone your repsority on the desktop just go to th upper right corner and press file. After you do that a little box will apear and you pick the repository you want to clone. It will ask you where you want to put yours, I selected mine to open in Notepad++ and I also saved it to one of my files for this class. So when I click on the file it will update auntomatically.

 Descrpition: CTI 110 Im mainly using this Github account for school purposes. It is the basic level account that is free to use,nothing fancy just short an simple.
So this repository is a basic one I belive the point is to create a basic webpage if you will. This one created a link that if you click it It'll show you exactly what I have typed on Github. Now there are two ways you can make this from what I have discovered.
Ok so in order to clone your repsority on the desktop just go to the upper right corner and press file. After you do that a little box will apear and you pick the repository you want to clone. It will ask you where you want to put yours, I selected mine to open in Notepad++ and I also saved it to one of my files for this class. So when I click on the file it will update auntomatically.
Or you can Click on the "+" icon in the top left corner of the screen and select "Clone a repository." This will open a window that shows a list of your Github repositories.
Step 2: Choose the repository you want to clone from the list of your Github repositories. In this case, select the repository with the name "username.github.io."
Step 3: Choose the location on your computer where you want to clone the repository. You can either choose an existing folder or create a new one.
Step 4: Click on "Clone repository." This will download a copy of the repository to your computer
The first step you can do online or on the desketop and the second way you can do on your file opener or on the desketop
